<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a proud graduate of California State University, Long Beach (CSULB), I've always been driven by a passion for technology and innovation. My journey through the world of Computer Science has not only shaped my professional outlook but has also instilled in me a profound appreciation for the challenges and opportunities that lie at the intersection of technology and business. Beyond the confines of technology, I find balance and excitement in the thrill of surfing and the discipline of Muay Thai, activities that remind me of the importance of resilience and adaptability both in and out of the water.</p>

<p>Family means the world to me, and I cherish every moment spent with them. It's these moments that ground me and provide the strength to pursue my ambitions relentlessly. Currently, I am on a new adventure, navigating the rigorous path of law school. This endeavor represents not just a personal goal, but a strategic step towards blending the realms of technology, law, and business to drive forward innovation in a responsible and impactful way.</p>

<p>In tandem with my legal studies, I co-founded an AI company focused on revolutionizing the way firms in industrial and commercial real estate operate. Alongside my business partner and our dedicated team, we're committed to optimizing workflows, reducing operational costs, and securing more deals for our clients. Our mission is to leverage cutting-edge AI solutions to empower businesses in these sectors, ensuring they stay ahead in a rapidly evolving marketplace. It's a journey of continuous learning, innovation, and collaboration that I am incredibly excited to be a part of.</p>
